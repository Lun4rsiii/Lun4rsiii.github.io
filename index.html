            <h2>Visions!</h2>
     <p><strong>In Genshin Impact, a Vision is a jeweled amulet bestowed by the gods (Celestia) to individuals in Teyvat who possess strong ambitions and the potential for godhood, granting them the ability to channel one of the seven elemental powers (Pyro, Hydro, Electro, Cryo, Dendro, Anemo, Geo) and fight. These "allogenes" receive their Vision when their fervent desires align with a specific moment and elemental virtue, helping them overcome obstacles to achieve their goals, though the exact criteria remain mysterious.</strong></p>

<h2> Archons !</h2>

    <p><strong> The Archons of Genshin Impact are the seven divine rulers presiding over the nations of Teyvat, each embodying an element and a specific ideal. They are gods who won the Archon War 2,000 years ago, earning a "Gnosis" from Celestia to rule, and are distinct from other gods by their seat among "The Seven". Though over the course of there rule, some have fallen and successors have taken there place (I will show the ones that are currently in the game...) </strong></p>
